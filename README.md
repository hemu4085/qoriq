# Qoriq — Data Readiness (v1.0)

Qoriq is a small prototype Streamlit app for dataset readiness and lightweight data-cleaning workflows. It helps you profile CSV datasets, detect common data issues, compute a simple Data Quality (DQ) score, preview naive fixes, and export cleaned CSVs plus a manifest of applied changes.

Features
- Upload CSV and preview data.
- Automatic profiling (counts, missingness, basic stats).
- Issue detection (missing values, bad formats, duplicates, simple domain checks).
- Naive bulk fixes (median imputation, simple date normalization, basic masking).
- Preview before applying fixes and export cleaned CSV + manifest.
- Minimal test suite and CI (GitHub Actions with pytest + ruff).

Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app
   ```powershell
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Development & tests
- Run the test suite:
  ```powershell
  pip install pytest
  pytest -q
  ```
- A minimal smoke test is included so CI can validate the pipeline. Add more unit tests under tests/ as you expand functionality.

Repository layout
- app.py — Streamlit UI entry point
- src/ — core library modules (profiler.py, validator.py, quality.py, fixer.py, ...)
- examples/sample_data/ — sample CSVs for manual testing
- tests/ — pytest unit tests
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — GitHub Actions workflow (pytest + ruff)

Release & tagging
- Tag a release locally and push:
  ```powershell
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "Qoriq v1.0 — initial prototype"
  git push origin v1.0
  ```
- Create a GitHub release with the gh CLI:
  ```powershell
  gh release create v1.0 --title "Qoriq v1.0" --notes "Initial prototype: profiler, validator, quality, fixer, Streamlit UI, sample data, tests"
  ```

Contributing
- Open issues and PRs; please include tests for new behavior.
- Use the established code style (ruff) and consider running local tests before pushing.

Security & maintenance suggestions
- Add Dependabot for dependency updates (.github/dependabot.yml).
- Consider branch protection for main and enable required CI checks.
- For production use, add domain-specific validation profiles and stronger fix review/auditing.

License
- Add a LICENSE file to declare your preferred license (MIT recommended for prototypes).
